    <h2>To-Do</h2>

    <p>
        In order of priority unless feedback or other circumstances dictates otherwise:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Add caching of instrumented source (switch option?)</li>
            <li>Documentation on usage rather than refer to JSCoverage URL</li>
            <li>
                100% ECMAScript support (see @Ignore tests in
                <a href="https://github.com/tntim96/JSCover/blob/master/src/test-integration/java/jscover/instrument/InstrumentAndHighlightRegressionTest.java">InstrumentAndHighlightRegressionTest</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Tidy logic in ParseTreeInstrumenter</li>
            <li>Add branch coverage</li>
            <li>Add API for headless testing without the need of network</li>
            <li>JavaScript syntax highlighting</li>
            <li>Add in check-style</li>
            <li>SSL proxy support? Combine with another tool?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The code is currently compatible with JSCoverage, but major changes are likely to be implemented.
        The first of these will probably be to remove the JavaScript source from the instrumented JavaScript.
        If someone would like to fork JSCoverage and maintain compatibility, let us know.
    </p>
