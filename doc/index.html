    <p>
        JSCover is a tool that measures code coverage for JavaScript programs.
        It is a Java implementation of the excellent
        <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/">JSCoverage</a> tool, and much of the
        documentation currently available at that site is applicable to JSCover.
    </p>

    <p>
        JSCover is free software, distributed under the
        <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License version 2</a>.

    <h2>Why choose JSCover</h2>

    <p>
        Reasons that you might choose to use JSCover are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You need coverage measured via a browser (e.g. your tests include DOM interaction)</li>
        <li>JSCover will run anywhere Java does (NB: JSCoverage may not run on all your platforms)</li>
        <li>Quick and easy to set-up</li>
        <li>JSCover is under active development</li>
        <li>
            JSCover is architecturally simple and modular, and so should be easy to
            contribute to and maintain, hopefully ensuring a long life-time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current State</h2>

    <p>
        JSCover is ready to use in server mode, and should support most language features, the most notable omission
        being the <i>getter</i>/<i>setter</i> logic.
        Also, check these <a href="to-do.html">To-Do</a>s don't affect you.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you find a bug please report it and we'll endeavour to correct it.
        Alternatively, you can try <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/">JSCoverage</a>
        (N.B. JSCoverage also does not support branch coverage).
    </p>

    <p>
        If running as part of a test suite, the test suite should be run a second time without instrumentation to
        ensure consistent behaviour.
    </p>

    <h2>Contribute</h2>

    <p>
        Please feel free to contribute - see the <a href="to-do.html">To-Do</a> list.
        The difficulty level for contributing patches varies depending on the area.

    <p>
        Rhino bugs can be posted <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">there</a>, but please notify us to avoid
        duplication. If the report is urgent and includes a patch, it can be manually patched and included in JSCover.
