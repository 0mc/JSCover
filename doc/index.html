        JSCover is a tool that measures code coverage for JavaScript programs.
        It is a Java implementation of the excellent
        <a href="http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/">JSCoverage</a> tool, and much of the
        documentation currently available at that site is applicable to JSCover.
    </p>

        JSCover is free software, distributed under the
        <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License version 2</a>.

    <h2>Why choose JSCover</h2>

    <p>
        Reasons that you might choose to use JSCover are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You need coverage measured via a browser (e.g. your tests include DOM interaction).</li>
        <li>JSCover will run anywhere Java does (NB: JSCoverage may not run on all your platforms).</li>
        <li>Quick and easy to set-up</li>
        <li><a href="documentation.html#todo">These limitations/To-Dos</a> don't affect you.</li>
        <li>JSCover is under active development (see <a href="documentation.html#future">future</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In general though, if you can run JSCoverage, it is the superior tool if you use
        <i>ECMAScript Language Specification</i> features currently not supported by this tool.
    </p>

    <h2>Current State</h2>

    <p>
        JSCover is ready to use in server mode, but currently does not support
        100% <i>ECMAScript Language Specification</i>. JSCover is currently beta quality, but
        from little things...
    </p>

    <p>
        If running as part of a test suite, the test suite should be run a second time without instrumentation to
        ensure consistency.
    </p>
