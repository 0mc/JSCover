    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Remove JavaScript source From JSON</h3>
            This is to allow the application to scale for large code bases.
            The source is now stored in the report directory under 'original-src'.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Re-structure _$jscoverage Object</h3>
            This is to elegantly accommodate branch coverage properties and any additional
            future properties.
            It also removes a mix of coverage-array data and object properties.
